# linuxmuster-api

Linuxmuster API is the main evolution for the next linuxmuster.net's server, version 8.
Based on the wonderful [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), it will give the possibility to let other software to interact with the data and tools provided by the linuxmuster.net's server.

## Installation

Simply install the package `linumxuster-api7` from our [deb repository](https://github.com/linuxmuster/deb).
Beware: this package is only published for developing purpose, DON'T USE IT ON A 7.2 PRODUCTION SERVER.

After the installation, the `uvicorn` server should start automatically ans listen on port 8001.
You can manage it via `systemctl`:

    systemctl start linuxmuster-api
    systemctl stop linuxmuster-api

## Configuration

Some configurations options are stored in `/etc/linuxmuster/api/config.yml`:

  * uvicorn:
    * port: 8001 (default)
    * host: 0.0.0.0 (default)
    * ssl_certfile: /etc/linuxmuster/api/lmnapi.pem (self-signed, default)
    * ssl_keyfile: /etc/linuxmuster/api/lmnapi.pem (self-signed, default)
    * log_level: info (default)
    * log_config: /etc/linuxmuster/api/log_conf.yaml (default, configuration of the *logging* Python module)
  * secret: secret key generated by the install process in order to generate JWT tokens, keep it secret.
  * cors: (some examples)
    * allow_origins:
        - http://example.com
        - https://localhost:8001
    * allow_credentials: true
    * allow_methods:
        - GET
        - POST
    * allow_headers: ['*']

## First steps

FastApi provides two complete documentations to learn the API:

  * https://SERVER:8001/docs : Swagger UI, you can see all endpoints and interact directly with all of these
  * https://SERVER:8001/redoc: Full documentation about all endpoints.

### Security

The endpoints are per role and per user secured. 
Each request MUST provide a valid **JWT (JSON Web Token)** in the header (key `X-Api-Key`) to get the data.

You can get a valid JWT token by sending username and password via Basic auth at the endpoint https://SERVER:8001/v1/auth.

### First request

You are yet so far to launch your first request, just send a GET request with your JWT to https://SERVER:8001/v1/schoolclasses and you will get a whole list of all schoolclasses on the server ! Have fun with it :)

## Development

This project is pretty young and there's many room for improvement:

  * add all necessary endpoint to provide enough flexibility,
  * correctly handle all type of errors (500, 401, 404, ...),
  * and many more ... any help is welcome.
